## Project

this project started with this prompt:

npub1r3kty2vkh247jgdu63wgkcsnktdtp9hc3e962eudg0getgvxs4gsz4uytc this npub represents the rektbot. The rektbot posts a message each time a leveraged trader on bitcoin got busted.
It's one of two possible type of messages:
"Long Rect:..." or "Short Rekt:..."

I want to have a simple statistical view on the number of short/long messages the rektbot is posting. Long/short should be seperated in two time series on the same graph.

Also it now has a backend Database to store the data in.
